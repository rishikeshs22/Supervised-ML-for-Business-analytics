## Linear Regression
3.a You need to write Code for multi-variable linear regression <br>
Functions of your code should be easily readable and reusable.<br>

Given a data set (CarPrice_Assignment.csv). The data set is about predicting the car price based on features given(such as height, width, power, etc.)<br>
Only use following features to train your model <br>
* carlength<br>
* carwidth<br>
* carheight<br>
* enginesize<br>
* stroke<br>
* horsepower<br>
* price<br>

Split the data set into training and testing data set in 80:20 ratio.<br>
Train your model with the training data set and report the accuracy of your model based on testing data set.<br>

3.b Here a word problem for you-<br>
Person A wants to buy a car but he is not willing to ask for the price of the car as he is an introvert. The features of the car that he want to buy are <br>
carlength - 190.9<br>

carheight - 54.9<br>
enginesize    - 183<br>
stroke    - 3.64<br>
horsepower - 123<br>
Help person A to find the price of the car.<br>
